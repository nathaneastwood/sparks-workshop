# Introduction

This half-day workshop is intended to be a brief look into the core components of R package building and using `sparklyr`. It is very heavily influenced by the excellent [R Packages Book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham. In this workshop you will learn how to write reproducible R code in the form of functions and how to test and document them.
