Some great free R books are available:

* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz)
* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) covers the `dplyr` package which works seamlessly with `sparklyr`.

# Linting

Generally I have stuck to the [tidyverse coding standards](http://style.tidyverse.org). These standards were implemented with the [Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/coding-standards/r.html). You can automatically format your code using two packages.

## `lintr`

The `sparkts` package automatically runs [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) to check for style errors during the test phase of the package check or when running `devtools::test()`. You can install `lintr` with:

```{r lint}
remotes::install_github("jimhester/lintr")
```

Then to run the linter run

```{r run_lint}
lintr::lint_package()
```

## `styler`

The goal of `styler` is to provide non-invasive pretty-printing of R source code while adhering to the [tidyverse formatting rules](http://style.tidyverse.org). You can run `styler` on your entire package using

```{r style_pkg}
styler::style_pkg()
```

Or you can style an individual file using the RStudio Addin.
