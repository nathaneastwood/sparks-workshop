# Functions (`R/`)

Everything in R is an object. Everything we do to an object is a function.

To write functions, we use the `function()` key word.

![Figure 1: How to write a quick function](https://media.giphy.com/media/C9E08n1ssdGuudtQFk/giphy.gif)

Functions follow the following format

```{r fun_ex, eval = TRUE}
quick_maths <- function(add1, add2, sub1) {
  cat(
    add1, " plus ", add2, " is ", add1 + add2, " minus ", sub1, ", that's ",
    add1 + add2 - sub1, "\nQuick maths!", sep = ""
  )
  BRRR::skrrrahh("bigshaq")
  invisible(add1 + add2 - sub1)
}

quick_maths(2, 2, 1)
```

## Returning

Unlike python, in R you do not need an explicit `return()` at the end of a function. The only time you need this is for early returns, for example in an `if ()` statement. The last statement of a function is returned be default in R.

## Invisibly Returning

Notice that the function above returns a value invisibly. This is useful for when you want the function to return something to be used later, but don't want to print it to the console.

```{r invis, eval = TRUE}
x <- quick_maths(2, 2, 1)
x + 5
```

## The Assignment Operator

The assignment operator in R is `<-` but `=` works in the same way. It is best practice to use `<-`.

## The Pipe Operator

The pipe operator (`%>%`) has become a common tool within the R world. Introduced in the `magrittr` package, we read this symbol as "then". It it used to "pipe" the left hand side into a function on the right hand side. It is used heavily within the "tidyverse".

```{r dplyr}
library(dplyr)

mtcars %>% 
  filter(mpg > 20) %>% 
  select(mpg, cyl, hp)
```

## Argument Names

We don't need to explicitly state the argument names. In fact we can reorder the names or use shortened names (this is not good practice, however).

```{r arg_names, eval = TRUE}
quick_maths(add2 = 2, sub1 = 1, add1 = 2)
quick_maths(su = 1, 2, 2)
```

## Getting Help

You can get help in R using either the `?` function or the `help()` function.

```{r help}
?print
```

You can search for things within R using `??` or `help.search()`.

```{r help_search}
??print
```

## Installing R Packages

We install packages with the `install.packages()` function.

```{r install}
install.packages("sparklyr")
```

To install a package from GitHub you can use the `remotes` package, first to install itself, and then to install a package.

```{r remotes}
# Install remotes
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-lib/remotes/master/install-github.R")$value("r-lib/remotes")
# Use remotes to install the development version of sparklyr
remotes::install_github("rstudio/sparklyr")
```

## Loading R Packages

We can load R packages using one of two functions: `library()` or `require()`. You [should use](https://yihui.name/en/2014/07/library-vs-require/) `library()`, however. 

One bad consequence of `require()` is that if you `require('foo')` in the beginning of an R script, and use a function `bar()` in the `foo` package on line 175, R will throw an error `object "bar" not found` if `foo` was not installed.

```{r library, eval = TRUE}
library(sparklyr)
```
